# Notes:

Simple little app that runs in the Noticiation Area (aka [System Tray](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/10/54831.aspx)) so that when you press WinKey+J, it'll create (or open) a journal entry in OneNote for today's date.

### ToDo:
* Update so that it'll work with any version of OneNote.
